<p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>Unapproved Minutes January 22, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Cascadia School Library</p>
<p>Directors present: Amanda Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Ellen Beck, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:30.</p>
<p>People introduced themselves.</p>
<p>Minutes of Nov. 20, 2019 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report 11-19-2019 through 1-15-2020 was approved.  Ellen noted that there was an additional deposit made and she would include it on the subsequent treasurer’s report. Amanda discussed her work with Randy Wiger on the proposal for the off-leash dog area at Mineral Springs Park. M/S/A that Licton Springs will contribute the value of Amanda’s work hours on this project for the future development of the proposal.  She estimates it as $100 thus far.   The group also discussed using the funds earmarked for Licton Springs Park, possibly for a summer event, with Liz’s approval because of her work as the forest steward for the park.</p>
<p>The group discussed the designation of Licton Springs Park for historic status, given its significance to the Native American communities of the region.  The process is underway and has almost reached the last stage for approval.</p>
<p>Debora Juarez (referred to in these notes below as DJ) and her staff member, Shayna Daitch (SD), joined us (delayed due to police activity in downtown Seattle due to a shooting incident earlier). DJ discussed her understanding of the history of some issues associated with the Duwamish tribe and their designation. She said the Parks Dept .(Superintendent Jesús Aguirre) had informed her of the designation decision.</p>
<p>The results of a survey of Licton Springs area residents was discussed.  DJ had it with her as LSCC had sent the results ahead and distributed a summary on our listserv (attached below)</p>
<p>DJ was asked to update the group on plans for a feasibility study of an Aurora-Licton Springs Community Center. She discussed the role of Jesús Aguirre and the Parks Dept. which will work with a community group to start the process.  $150,000 has been designated.  SD will be the point person staff contact.  DJ noted that the 6 year cycle for funding for Parks and Recreation is approaching and the feasibility study should be completed in a year.  She discussed her effort to secure the funding and the fact that the neighborhood is located in a “community center desert” in the City.  The PDOC (Park District Oversight Committee) is key to the process and once the 2020 census data comes in, that should help make the case.  DJ noted that this neighborhood has seen much growth of <em>families</em> in particular.</p>
<p>DJ then discussed all the activity occurring in District Five and how the Aurora, Northgate, and other neighborhoods are morphing into true family-oriented areas.  She talked about the need for sidewalks, a perennial problem in North Seattle. (note: residents from the Licton Springs neighborhood attended and asked her questions during the meeting so some of these notes are her responses to the questions). Subsequent to the 2019 general election, she has met with Council members Dan Strauss (District 6) and Alex Pedersen (District 4) to coordinate on issues impacting North Seattle and she is encouraged about how the representatives will work together.</p>
<p>She focused on infrastructure and development around Northgate and emphasized that much of the construction will be down with local union labor.  Newer low income housing will be constructed in the Northgate area and any current resident displaced will be able to move back in.</p>
<p>Asked about plans for the North Precinct Police Station, DJ reviewed what was the impediment to earlier plans to build a new station. Plans are till underway and there will be community hearings at North Seattle College.  Lisa Herboldt is now chair of the committee that will deal with the issue and DJ is hopeful action will happen. DJ noted that the City is still handicapped by the insufficient number of police officers and we need to be attracting many more.</p>
<p>Lindsey Webb asked about plans for a grocery store at Northgate and DJ said she is pleased with cooperation from Simon (major property owner) but City officials can only do so much where private property is involved. She has discussed, however, the demographics and character of the neighborhood and her preference for a union-shop grocery store to move into the new development.</p>
<p>Neighbors from Interlake Avenue asked about attention to development west of I-5, such as the need for a supermarket, and raised concern about the focus not being solely around the Northgate area. The group then discussed with DJ the need for attracting businesses along the Aurora corridor, including small enterprises, and reviewed pushback from Aurora Merchants to past efforts such as the moratorium and other work spearheaded by ALUV.  Again, DJ reiterated that where private property and a state highway (99) is involved, the City has a more limited role.  She discussed her efforts to work with Seattle Public Schools as the owner of the Oak Tree Village property, but that headway has not yet been made for any firm plans.</p>
<p>Janice Lichtenwaldt noted the work of ALUV and the new group, “For North” and that she has been attending some ALUV meetings and in contact with Casey Pier and there is hope to have a new phase of cooperation with business owners in the Aurora area. Amanda Crosley asked what LSCC can do to be helpful about encouraging business development, for example, with the west side of the upcoming pedestrian-bicycle bridge across I-5.  DJ noted the complications because of N Seattle College and University of Washington ownership of much of the land where the bridge ends up on the west side.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking ceremony for the bridge construction is coming up soon. SD noted that there is a need for letters of support for DJ who is calling for speeding up the Sound Transit plans for the 130<sup>th</sup> St light rail station to make it designed for a 2024 opening (to match Lynnwood link) rather than wait until 2031, which doesn’t make sense. SD will email Kathleen Braden with appropriate contact addresses to pass along.</p>
<p>The group was very happy to receive the news from DJ that the Home Zones projects are approved for money in the City budget.  In addition, SDOT has allocated $40,000 out of the regular SDOT budget for a Licton Springs Home Zone, a project supported earlier by LSCC, spearheaded by Amanda and Tim Crosley.</p>
<p>The group thanked Council Rep. Juarez and Shayna Daitch for attending and then proceeded with other business after they had to leave:</p>
<p>Resident Brigette Arden suggested that the survey done by LSCC be repeated on a regular basis to have a longitudinal record of responses and members of the LSCC Board agreed. The group discussed clean-up issues and problems with the 95<sup>th</sup> and Interlake area, especially associated with litter. Tracy Cramer, with Seattle Public Utilities and the person who deals with clean-up, attended and discussed how to report problem areas and the best way to send information to the City so that there can be a good response. She noted in particular the limitations the City or Public Utilities are under legally with respect to RVs and a 25 ft perimeter where crews are constrained about removals of trash. She took the information and said they will try to send out a crew to do cleanup on Stone Ave. N.</p>
<p>Amanda gave a report on the December 21 Mineral Springs holiday celebration and thanked everyone who participated. About fifty people attended despite the rain.  LSCC plans to do this event again in 2020.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that we now have an electronic archive of the minutes dating back to the 1990s although there are some missing years from the mid-1990s.  It will be posted on the LSCC web site and can be searched using keywords.</p>
<p>Janice Lichtenwaldt noted the upcoming grants workshop Jan. 25 at Bitter Lake if anyone wanted to attend.</p>
<p>Kathleen Braden noted the KIRO radio selection of Liz Kearns for their “Hometown hero” award in December.  Liz said she would be doing a work party for the park with second-graders from Cascadia School. Amanda reported on the Jan 20 tree plating at 85<sup>th</sup> and Meridian.</p>
<p>Several Board members attended the January 5 Open House at North Seattle College on the I-5 Pedestrian-Bicycle Bridge.</p>
<p>Ellen proposed that LSCC order more copies of the Licton Springs brochure and the item will be on the agenda for the Feb. 26 meeting.</p>

                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>Approved Minutes November 20, 2019 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Cascadia School Hallway</p>
<p>Directors present Melanie Davies, Thomas Stachiw, Amanda Crosley, Tim Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Ellen Beck, Liz Kearns, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:30. She asked people present to introduce themselves. Dianne Trani from jet City Property visited and Lindsey Webb who will soon be joining the board.</p>
<p>Treasurer’s Report of Oct 16-Nov 20 2019 and minutes from October 16 2019 were approved with correction of typo.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Events and applications</span>: Amanda had completed the Arts in the Park application for a Dec. 21 event at Mineral Springs Park and LSCC was awarded the grant.  There will be a clothing drive, music, food, card making, and sugar plum elves. Entertainment and a port-a-potty will be provided and Amanda is currently in process of recruiting volunteers.  Kathleen will help Liz who is looking into finding another musician group.</p>
<p>Liz noted the Dec 7 lighting for Licton Springs park and the lights will be up until Jan 11.  Epic Life Church will have a small ceremony to turn on the lights and Liz noted that special care will be taken for the safety of the light hangers.  Liz will send Kathleen an announcement to post and to ask for LED light donations.</p>
<p>The group noted the summer movie program for Mineral Springs Park and the application that was submitted for a Native American celebration in Licton Springs Park in July (thank you Janice!).  We discussed whether we would need a business license from the City of Seattle and if it turns out we need it due to revenue amount, Janice will look into it.</p>
<p>Melanie reported on Halloween event and had emailed Kathleen the cost and donations summary:</p>
<p>Expenses</p>
<p>Musicians                              $100.00</p>

<p>Donations                             $203.77</p>
<p>Liz reminded us of the second-Saturday work parties in Licton Springs Park and the group noted the press coverage of the Landmarks Preservation Board action regarding Native American significance of the park (reported in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Seattle Times</span> and Crosscut). Liz said there will be 3-4 work parties coming up for Mineral Springs Park and while there have been some rough campers there, tent campers have not been observed.  The disk golf people also plan some work parties.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Online vote results</span>- the board voted by email to add the City of Seattle to our insurance coverage and to allocate $500 toward the matching grant portion of the application for the Native American summer celebration grant.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Other business</span>- Amanda noted that the Parks Dept felt LSCC did not need a business license and will send Kathleen verification of that for the record.  She reported on our Paypal account to take donations and recommended transferring money to our bank account on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Kathleen will send out a reminder to people to fill out our survey.  Debora Juarez plans to attend our Jan. 15 meeting and we agreed we can send her the survey results ahead so she knows that issues are on the minds of Licton Springs residents.</p>
<p>Liz asked LSCC members as individuals to send letters of support for an effort by Thornton Creek Alliance to keep funding for Green Seattle Partnership in City budget.</p>
<p>Janice reported that Leah Anderson from ALUV was reaching out to local community council leaders for a get-together. Melanie, Liz, and Kathleen reported on a recent ReVisioning Northgate meeting.</p>

<p>This was Thomas’s last meeting as a member of the Board and he noted he had enjoyed serving and would help as he was able in the future. Thank you for your service, Thomas!</p>
<p>Janice closed the meeting at 8:30 PM.</p>

<p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>Unapproved Minutes October 16, 2019 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Cascadia School Library</p>
<p>Directors present Melanie Davies, Thomas Stachiw, Amanda Crosley, Tim Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Ellen Beck, Liz Kearns, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:30 and all are happy to be able to hold meetings inside the Cascadia School.  She asked people present to introduce themselves.</p>
<p>Treasurer’s Report of Sept 19-Oct 16 2019 and minutes from June 19 2019 were approved.</p>
<p>Melanie reported on upcoming Halloween event for Licton Springs Park and noted we could use one more volunteer for the Friends of the Forest positions.  She thanked Ellen for taking on the cider table.  We appreciate how long Liz handled this function for us!</p>
<p>Robin Amadon and Aisaya Corbray from Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) made a presentation on plans for a mixed income structure on Aurora Avenue at the Nesbit site where the tiny house village was located until this year.  LIHI envisions a seven-story structure and 118 units (see attachment). If all goes well, LIHI is hoping to have it opened by spring 2022.  Robin discussed funding sources, design, and plan for mixed types.  Parking will  not be provided but LIHI hopes to attract people who use non-automobile forms of traffic.  She also discussed ways to secure the walls until construction can start to discourage tagging.  LIHI would like future help from LSCC in announcing public meetings as the project proceeds.  Kathleen will email Robin and Aisaya the email addresses for the LSCC directors.</p>
<p>Eric Blumhagen, who is a candidate for the Seattle School Board, visited and discussed some of the issues he feels are most important and asked for input.</p>
<p>Thomas Whittemore of the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods discussed the City’s efforts to ensure a good rate of participation for the upcoming 2020 census.</p>
<p>Leah Andersen from ALUV vii\sited and discussed the meeting held recently with Debora Juarez and efforts to find funding for a feasibility study for an Aurora-Licton Springs Community Center.  She noted possible availability of a parcel where Quiring Monuments are currently located on Aurora. There will be an upcoming budget discussion and D. Juarez has proposed funding for the study and Leah would like to see support from the area.</p>
<p>M/S/A <em>he Licton Springs Community Council supports the efforts of Debora Juarez to secure funding for a feasibility study to create a community center for the Aurora-Licton Springs area. The LSCC will continue to monitor this issue and communicate progress to our neighborhood email list of residents and via other social media platforms</em>. Kathleen will send to the City Council and to Deputy Mayor Moseley and post to the Licton Springs Facebook page, send to email list.</p>
<p>The group discussed various assignments for Board members that came out of the Sept Board retreat. Amanda, Janice, and Kathleen will follow up re a survey of residents and also Kathleen will post notes from the retreat unless she hears any objections by email before Oct 23.</p>
<p>Janice reported on communications with schools and North Seattle College. The group discussed plans for a residential facility at the college (which may be delayed) and the one year extension of the P-Patch on the college grounds.</p>
<p>Megan Hazen gave us addresses for parent groups from Cascadia and Eagle Staff schools and said that development of regular communication would be good between the PTAs and the LSCC: <a href="mailto:communications@Cascadiapta.org">communications@Cascadiapta.org</a> and <a href="mailto:info@eaglestaffptsa.org">info@eaglestaffptsa.org</a>.</p>
<p>Liz noted that Epic Life Church will be doing holiday lights in the Licton Springs park again.  She and Janice attended the Landmarks Preservation Board meeting Oct. 16 and the request for Licton Springs park to have historic status was approved.  It will make the park the only Native American site in the City so designated.    Janice will send a congratulations message to Urban Native Education Alliance people.</p>
<p>Thomas presented ideas on signage to solicit people who might be interested in joining the Board and Kathleen discussed the possibility of having an Advisory Board for the Community Council. The group also agreed to set up a “who we are” part of our website to identify Board members.</p>
<p>Thomas will be leaving the Board after December and Lindsey Webb was unanimously approved to be appointed to fill in Thomas’s term per Article VII-4 of by-laws. [^1]</p>
<p>Janice closed the meeting at 8:30 PM.</p>

                <p>NOTES FROM SEPT 28, 2019 RETREAT LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</p>
<p>10 AM – 12 PM at Meridian Center for Health, Seattle</p>
<p>Notetaker: Kathleen Braden, Secretary</p>
<p>All Board members present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Thomas Stachiw, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, Liz Kearns, Amanda Culp-Crosley, Timothy Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Members thanked Janice for her organization and the room decorations to get us in a productive mood!  Various members brought in food and beverages.</p>
<p>Janice distributed documents including an agenda and time allocation for each item to keep us on track. She welcomed everyone and explained the plan for the retreat. Board members reviewed accomplishments for 2018-19.</p>
<p>Members were then invited to state what they felt priorities should be for 2019-20 and Melanie Davies noted items on the whiteboard.</p>
<p>The group then reviewed some operational guidelines for how the discussion would proceed.  Janice created a “Parking Lot” space for the whiteboard for items that occur to members but that we would park for subsequent discussion.</p>
<p>The group reviewed data on LSCC activities and some population profile data based on 1990 and 2010 Censuses to get an idea of distinctives of Licton Springs neighborhood.</p>
<p>Ellen Beck gave a Treasurer’s report and the group discussed ideas on financial side (more fundraising, more equipment, more events, paying for a newsletter editor and distribution, grants to reflect our diverse community, Arts in the Park, visit-consult with Mark mendez of Lake City.</p>
<p>Janice brought up the manner in which we take donations and payment of dues.  Amanda noted Amazon Smile and Janice and Ellen are going to verify that we are set for that  Kathleen will check on access to Paypal account.</p>
<p>Janice noted her hope that we will create both a fundraising committee and a marketing-outreach committee and that we not miss the chance for some items we might sell such as tee shirts or bumper stickers. She noted such committees do not need to be just Board members but we could recruit members of the community who might be willing to serve.</p>
<p>Amanda discussed how we might use existing funds we have in our account.  Melanie noted the City’s fundraising workshops for community activists.</p>
<p>Other issues that were brought up included relations with schools in area, including North Seattle College, parking issue sin neighborhood, historic status of Licton Springs park and surrounding neighborhood, more on fundraising, and business relations, particularly with advent of NORA (North Aurora Business, a brainchild of Epic Life Church). Jan noted the passing of Faye Garneau and she will be sending a message of condolence on behalf of the council, pointing out Faye’s contribution to citizen activism as a business owner in the area.  Jan also underscored her interest that the Council start a system to have recognition of people/organizations who have made a positive impact on Licton Springs.</p>
<p>Board members then engaged in a prioritization process and various people agreed to be point people on the priorities as follows:</p>
<p>Janice—School relations</p>
<p>Liz- Licton Springs historic status (park, neighborhood)</p>
<p>Melanie- representing LSCC to other meetings and organizations</p>
<p>Kathleen &amp; Thomas- Recruiting more Board members</p>
<p>Amanda- Events</p>
<p>Tim- engagement &amp; efficiency for monthly meetings</p>

<p>Directors present: Thomas Stachiw, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, Liz Kearns, Amanda Crosley, Tim Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Introductions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minutes Jan. 16 , 2019 were approved as distributed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letter from Tim Motzer to Debora Juarez from Lake City Neighborhood Alliance (attached) asking for the Council's endorsement. Directors discussed it and had questions about the fee structure and asked Kathleen to send note to Tim declining but that we hope in the future to have a discussion on MHA and fees with other community groups such as LCNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As FYI, Kathleen provided map of MHA zooning proposals and list of amendments that are up for vote in March by City Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion of Handy Andy business on Aurora.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amanda brought up Your Voice Your Choice request for proposals deadline approaching Feb 22 and the Neighborhood Street Fund program with votes due soon on proposals for Licton Springs and adjacent areas  Kathleen will send out to listserv remainder for people to go online and vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group discussed various techniques used by SDOT and DON that creates competition and even "popularity contests" among competing projects proposed by citizens.  Melanie suggested a letter about District Five being poorer than other districts in terms of sidewalks. Kathleen updated the group on proposal to improve signage in Licton Springs Park and her frustration with DON processes when this should merely be part of regular Parks maintenance schedule. She noted her intention to cease efforts to make a DON large grants proposal and will inform the d-hoc committee brought together in the fall, as well as PNA who had agreed to serve as sponsor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Amanda noted we did not get picked for the Arts in the Park projects and will explore other possibilities.  She will be looking into various grant options like Small Sparks and Neighborhood Matching Funds.  Kathleen suggested that any money LSCC had agreed to set aside from our parks fund for signage in Licton Springs Park might be redirected as matching seed money for the Arts or event projects Amanda is thinking of.</p>
<p>Melanie noted that Epic Life Church might do another Celebrate North Seattle event. It might be good to invite someone from the church to our next meeting. She also discussed ALUV efforts to do a zoning change from commercial to neighborhood-commercial.</p>
<p>We discussed the Home Zone project, SDOT, data on traffic measurement and Ed Irwin applying for speed bumps for traffic calming.</p>
<p>Melanie noted the Aurora pedestrian bridge artwork is now up and the daffodils planted there will soon be blooming.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that City Council District Five candidate John Lombard had indicated a desire to be at one of our meetings and the group noted he is welcome to come and listen but we have not had a tradition of inviting candidates in for their campaign promotions.  Kathleen will email him.</p>

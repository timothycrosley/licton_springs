                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>Approved Minutes July 15, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, Ellen Beck, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Janice Holkup</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.  </p>
<p>M/S/A to have Kathleen draft a letter to Councilwoman Juarez expressing our concern about unavailability of public restrooms at Licton Springs Park due to campers’ items and presence blocking access. Kathleen will send a draft to LSCC members.</p>
<p>M/S/A June 19, 2020 minutes as circulated.  There is no Treasurer’s Report for this period although Ellen did note a donation received. She will update us later.</p>
<p>The group discussed producing tee-shirts via a print-on-demand company, Zazzle, recommended by Janice (https://www.zazzle.com/).  The group discussed design ideas and M/S/A to allocate funds to pay a designer recommended by Melanie. Janice okayed the idea with Tom Speer of UNEA in conversation. </p>
<p>The group continued planning on August 19 event to make use of City’s invitation to use some of Arts in the Park event money since the full event could not occur due to the current virus.  Thank you to Janice and Lindsey for doing much of the planning re outreach to secure musicians and indigenous artists.  John at the UPS Store at Oak Tree offered to give us a good rate on yard signs and flyers to publicize the event. </p>
<p>LSCC received a request from John Lombard of D5 for support for a letter re zoning of the Halcyon Mobile Home Park to keep it available as a mobile home property.  The letter is still being constructed and M/S/A to authorize Janice and melanie to decide if LSCC can lend support for the letter once it is completed, since we do not meet in August. Melanie in particular would like to get more information from John and some of the model actions, such as Bothell’s, he referred to in portions of it drafted so far. </p>
<p>Next meeting is in September. (16th) but it was decided to delay further Board member selection processes until 2021 because of anticipated ongoing restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>Minutes submitted by Kathleen Braden, Secretary</p>

                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>approved Minutes June 19, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, Ellen Beck, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Susan Ward, Janice Holkup, Mike Cuadra, Mehul Shah, Dianne Trani, Sharon Bruce</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.</p>
<p>At our invitation, Susan ward of ReVisioning Northgate, attended and updated LSCC on activities around the Northgate area and actions taken by RN. She noted it was formed at grassroots level to advocate for green spaces and livable spaces and includes representatives from various on-profits as well as residents and businesses. The group discussed transportation issues, the underpass beneath I-5 at Northgate, METRO and its projects, including bus staging areas, parking impacts with impending light rail station, affordable housing, the tree code. The current pandemic has limited in-person meetings for the organization but it has been active in submitting commentary and letters.</p>
<p>Minutes of May 20, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report through was approved.</p>
<p>The group then turned to having an activity that is community-oriented. Janice noted we were informed that while our arts in the Park project was on hold due to pandemic, the City did allocate $1600 to LSCC for any culture-related activity in the neighborhood, particularly promoting diversity and justice and combatting bias. Janice shared the email and offered by email and at the meeting a set of ideas on how to use the funds. (attachment) Janice will check with our partners at Clear Sky, Dianne train offered to look into musicians, and Melanie suggested we do tee-shirts. Lindsey and Janice will do some organizing on a possible event in August. The date of August 19 seemed most likely.</p>
<p>It was agreed we would touch base on whether to have a Board retreat in the fall, similar to the one we had Sept. of 2019.</p>
<p>The group then discussed the issue of recruiting a more diverse Board membership. Kathleen noted data from 2010 census that indicated Licton Springs is one of the more ethnically and racially diverse neighborhoods north of the ship canal. (attachment) The group discussed the current climate for change, given local and national issues. Mehul weighed in about the need to do outreach to people who are not homeowners, perhaps leaving flyers near apartment buildings. Janice will provide the information about the local renters she met who were doing volunteer clean-up. Lindsey and Mehul offered to do a draft of a recruiting tool poster. Janice offered to write up a statement that could be posted on our web site and Facebook page. Kathleen, who is also a block watch captain, will contact North precinct officer David Gordo to see if there are any special instructions for people neighboring the precinct building and send it along to the Board if she receives any information.</p>
<p>Notes by Kathleen Braden, secretary.</p>
<p>Next meeting July 15 by Zoom</p>
<p>ATTACHMENTS</p>
<p>Email from Janice June 12, 2020 to the Board:</p>
<p>We are receiving $1,600 to do something for the neighborhood to uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and/or cultural content. The requirements seem very loose. Given these funds were was originally ear-marked to celebrate the sacred indigenous status of Licton Springs I’d love to put some of the funds toward that AND we can do anything. Below is the start of a brainstorming list. Any other ideas? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hire local artists to paint mail boxes in the neighborhood.  \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop, record, and host a podcast series, in partnership Clear    Sky, to celebrate the LS designation \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy colored chalk for the neighborhood to create their own sidewalk     murals. Take pictures and post on our Facebook and Instagram pages  and the blog \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hiring local artists to make chalk murals around the neighborhood \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hiring musicians to perform and stroll through the neighborhood on  different nights throughout the summer - bagpipes, saxophone,   trumpet, accordion, banjo, guitar \</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Dear Arts in Parks Partner,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your patience during these difficult and challenging times for our communities.  The work that many of you continue to do to support your community through all of this has been truly inspiring.  While we are no longer able to fund your originally proposed project in full, we are looking forward to working with you to support the work you are doing that benefits our community.  Seattle needs arts and culture now more than ever. We need you and the role you play in our sector’s ecosystem and in the civic life of our City as a whole. Even if the way you carry out your work has shifted, the value you provide cannot be underestimated. </p>
<p><strong>AWARD AMOUNT</strong></p>
<p>The attached invoice is for $1,600 to support a public benefit in lieu of your original project and funding amount.</p>
<p><strong>HERE’S ALL YOU NEED TO DO:      </strong></p>
<p><strong>Respond </strong>to this email to confirm that you have received it and with a brief description of the action or project that will take the place of your originally funded event and provides artistic or cultural public benefit (please see the backside of the attached invoice-report form for suggestions).</p>
<p>This should be an action or project that is in the spirit of and supports the goals of the Arts in Parks program, of supporting under resourced communities within Seattle and supports the efforts of <strong><a href="https://seattletogether.org/">Seattle Together</a></strong>which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and cultural    content</strong> (digital and analog) to residents, especially     vulnerable populations, by resourcing artists, organizers and other     cultural partners.  \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elevate, support, and uplift mutual aid efforts</strong> for     community resilience, efficacy and recovery driven by a dynamic     understanding of racial equity, neighborhood-level and cultural     community relationships, and digital technology access.   \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combatting bias/hate speech/harassment/violence</strong> amidst  Covid-19, with an awareness of how this could have impacts on   surveillance and policing practices disproportionately impacting    BIPOC communities. \</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Small-scale projects are fine and if it aligns with work that you were planning on doing to benefit your community, even better. It can be something done via an email, online, virtually, through social media, or any other method of distribution that aligns with public health guidance for physical distancing. We’re not looking for you to spend significant time making something happen. We are hoping the prompts will inspire your imagination, be forward thinking and accessible.  At this time, these funds should not be planned to go towards a postponed in-person park event.  </p>
<p>We ask that whatever action or project you do, to please include the tag #SeattleTogether and the City of Seattle logo found here: <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo">http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo#tabs-5</a> or provide written credit. (For example: “This project was supported by Arts in Parks, a partnership with Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Seattle Office of Arts &amp; Culture.”)</p>
<p><strong>Complete</strong> an action that provides artistic or cultural public benefit.  Please email a link and/or promotional item/information about your project at least a week prior to it taking place so that we can help share it out. </p>
<p><strong>Submit your invoice and report</strong>.

                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>approved Minutes May 20, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Janice Holkup, Mike Cuadra, Lindsey’s cats</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:35. She welcomed everyone. Mike Cuadra introduced himself as a former Board member. There was a discussion of zoning and urban village boundaries. Melanie will reach out to ALUV to see if there is any news on zoning.</p>
<p>There was a discussion of progress at Northgate and the Board decided to invite Susan Ward to participate in our next meeting, June 17, by zoom, if she is available to update us.</p>
<p>Minutes of April 15, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report through May 20, 2020 was approved.</p>
<p>Stay Healthy Street Program- many signs are up to close streets off in our neighborhood for vehicle traffic, as is being done throughout the city, due to the pandemic and need to maintain social distancing while people are out exercising. Janice attempted to reach Debra Juarez about the question of neighborhood input if the closures re made permanent, but she did not hear back despite also copying in her staff. Liz talked about meeting a parking enforcement officer while she and Ellen were walking but that the officer had no information about the program. Melanie suggested talking to ALUV and Greenlake CC. We looked at the West Seattle blog website and noted that Seattle Pedestrian Advisory Board and Greenways have been instrumental in the effort. The first public discussion did not occur until four weeks after the first closures were announced. Melanie and Janice will follow up. Lindsey suggested reaching out to Dan Strauss. Kathleen can contact Lee Bruch. Melanie will forward notes from Licton-Haller Greenways meeting (attached).</p>
<p>May 7 Durkan virtual town hall- Janice and Melanie attended. Janice presented our question about budget implications for Licton Springs neighborhood. The bottom line is that funds will be scarce to non-existent for projects due to huge decrease in sales tax revenue during the pandemic and business closures. Melanie provided the links sent out from the town hall and they are attached.</p>
<p>Liz asked what sort of services we could offer to the community and noted she received a nice thank you letter from Washington Food Fund for our contribution.</p>
<p>North Seattle College- Janice is our rep. and she noted that Chemane Crawford is the new interim president. We discussed the location of future residence halls on their campus but noted that due to the pandemic, it was less likely the halls would be constructed in the near future.</p>
<p>Arts-in-the-Park- although we received a greenlight for next phase of our project recognizing Licton Springs park as sacred space to Native Americans, the funding is cancelled for now from the City.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that the recruitment of people to an Advisory Board for the LSCC is put on hold until the fall due to the slowdown of activities with the pandemic.</p>
<p>Melanie reported on Seattle Arts Commission decision on temporary placements of art pieces that will be at either 92<sup>nd</sup> or 100<sup>th</sup> streets.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that Mary Amberg was leaving the police dept to take a job in the private sector and she had sent an email thanking Mary for her service to our neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Board agreed that the June and July meetings should be held via Zoom.</p>
<p>Notes by Kathleen Braden, secretary.</p>
<p>Next meeting June 17 by Zoom</p>

<p>approved Minutes April 15, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Amanda Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Janice Holkup, Tracy Cramer, Thomas Whittemore, Noah An, Dan Strauss, Mehul Shah</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:30.</p>
<p>Minutes of March 25, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report 3/26 through 4/14/2020 was approved.  Ellen said the next report would reflect full amount received re brevity donations.</p>
<p>City Council Representative from District 6, Dan Strauss, and his staff person, Noah An, attended.  The Council members thanked them for their time. Dan gave an overview of activities at his office during this time of COVID-19 contraction. He is holding meetings with constituents over the phone and continuing work on housing and transit issues.  He noted that Licton Springs borders both Districts 5 and 6 so he is available for inquiries from Licton Springs residents. Amanda asked him about the City Council work during the COVID-19 period and Dan explained that work continues, though at  a low level and there are lots of suggestions coming from the state government.  He noted the constraints on rents now and the strain on small businesses.  Melanie asked about his perspective on the community center plans for Licton Springs-Aurora and he noted he and Juarez are working cooperatively and he is following her lead on the issue. He noted that childcare is one of his priorities.  Kathleen asked about cooperative work among Strauss, Juarez, and Pedersen for North Seattle. Strauss reminded us that as a City Council rep. he is called upon to work on behalf of the whole city, not just District 6. He believes work on a new police station for the North Precinct should be coordinated- he recently did a “ride along” with North precinct staff. He concluded his visit by thanking Thomas Whittemore for delaying his retirement due to the current crisis.</p>
<p>Jordan Haselnus of Seattle Neighborhood Group was not able to attend but sent in a proposal for a cooperative effort to do a street cleanup in the Licton Springs- Aurora area or at Mineral Springs park.  Tracy Cramer noted that last year, the group did an amazing job. She will contact Jordan about her idea.  The group agreed that litter cleanup is important, but prefer to wait until the governor’s stay at home order is lifted in May so as not to send the wrong signal, especially since the City has suspended its own clean up campaigns.</p>
<p>Janice and Tracy will write up a short piece about litter cleanup work for the Love Licton blog.</p>
<p>Janice and Kathleen noted that the Bloodmobile has been suspended for now and Bloodworks is booked into May for individual appointments. Kathleen sent out a plea for support of local foodbanks to our listserv, but has not yet gotten any responses. Lindsey noted the Washington Food Fund under the governor’s council and Philanthropy Northwest (<a href="https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund">https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund</a>). M/S/A for LSCC to donate $200 each to the Washington Food Fund and to Epic Life Church for their neighborhood food bank.  Kathleen will send Ellen the addresses so she can send paper checks to each.</p>
<p>Kathleen reported on an effort to get North Precinct Block Watch captains organized for neighborhood self-help. Thomas Whittemore reported on the Seattle Together program by the City- it is a work in progress and will need guidance and approval. </p>
<p>The group discussed the ReVisioning Northgate email  from Susan Ward on the rerouting of bus routes around the Northgate area.  Kathleen will forward her email to the Council. </p>
<p>The Council agreed to discuss in the future the prospect of having a credit card or a debit card for the Council’s bank account.  Ellen will report at the May meeting on the rider for Public Schools on our insurance coverage, due to be renewed in June.</p>
<p>Janice provided images of some tee-shirts and other swag souvenirs with the Licton Springs cattail logo that could be manufactured and sold on demand both to raise money and create neighborhood solidarity. The Council will proceed with this although it was noted we need to take care of the tax and potentially, business license, implications.  Melanie is going to check with a friend who does design about the logo.  Janice, melanie, and Lindsey will form a team to see if it is possible to launch this effort by May 2, which is Neighbor Day</p>

<p>Next meeting May 20 either by Zoom or in Licton Springs Park.</p>

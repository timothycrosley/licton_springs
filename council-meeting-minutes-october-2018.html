<p>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Minutes of Oct 17 2018</span></p>
<p>Meridian Center for Health, 10521 Meridian Ave. N., Seattle 98133</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Directors Present</span>:  Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, Tim Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden.</p>
<p>Thomas Whittemore from DON visited the meeting, as well as Amanda Crosley.  The group had an informal discussion until 7:20 when an additional director joined us to from a quorum to do business.</p>
<p>Minutes of Sept 19 2018 and Treasurer's report 9/1/2018 to 9/30/2018 were both approved as distributed.</p>
<p>M/S/A that Licton Springs Community Council be a sponsor for the Arts in the Park proposal entitled "Outdoor Movie and Dog Party in Mineral Springs Park as authored by neighbor Amanda Crosley and distributed to Licton Springs Community Council members by email October 12, 2018:</p>
<p><strong>OUTDOOR MOVIE &amp; DOG PAWTY IN THE PARK 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Describe the activities of the festival, event, or project for which you are seeking funds. Include information about how arts and culture will be featured in your project or event. </strong></p>
<p>This event seeks to bring the community together over a free outdoor movie with booths for artists and vendors held in Mineral Springs Park. We are seeking funding for a movie public performance license, rental fees associated with a movie screen, generator, projector, marketing materials and for a port-a-potty as Mineral Springs Park does not have any public restrooms or electrical outlets. Our event will occur on a Saturday during the summer from 6 PM to 10 PM with art activities and community games held from 6 PM to 8 PM and the outdoor movie starting at sunset around 8 PM. If we receive AIP funding, the additional funds will go towards incentivizing more artists to attend, live music, children's activities (face painting, chalk, coloring, etc.) and towards increased marketing as we have found that lawn signs are very effective in previous events.</p>
<p><strong>2) Describe who will attend your event. How does your project use arts and culture to build community. Describe what your efforts will be to reach diversity populations and increase accessibility.</strong></p>
<p>The target audience for our event is the local community around Mineral Springs Park. We will leverage translated flyers and movie subtitles to increase the accessibility of our event. The movie will explore an under-represented culture such as Hispanic or Latino (ex: Coco) and be free and open to the public. We will seek out local businesses and artists for vendor spots at our event with a focus on diversity. For example, we will connect with North Seattle Community College (including the Licton Springs Review) and their Diversity Advisory Committee to reach out to students.We will also reach out to local organizations such as Epic Life Church, Aurora Licton Urban Village (ALUV) and Aurora Commons to increase our reach. Additionally, we will hand deliver flyers to transit centers, community centers, libraries, and other neighborhood gathering spots to reach those without internet access and connect with low-income neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>3) Provide a brief history of your arts programming and presenting activities. What evidence can you provide of your capacity to produce this event successfully. Describe any key partnerships. </strong></p>
<p>Licton Springs Community Council hosts annual events for the community such as the Licton Springs Halloween Walk (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/308149439973556/">https://www.facebook.com/events/308149439973556/</a>) and monthly events such as Friends of Licton Springs work parties (<a href="https://lictonsprings.org/work_party.pdf">https://lictonsprings.org/work_party.pdf</a>). Licton Springs Community Council will be partnering with LoveLicton.com and Friends of Mineral Springs Park to host this event.</p>
<p>LoveLicton.com partnered with the Seattle Parks &amp; Recreation department last summer, 2018, to put on this event. We had 4 vendors, 12 sponsors, and over 50 attendees. We hope to expand this event even further.  Facebook link to the event located here:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2045140935551342/"> https://www.facebook.com/events/2045140935551342/</a> and article here:<a href="https://lovelicton.com/outdoor_dog_pawty_and_movie_night_success.html"> https://lovelicton.com/outdoor_dog_pawty_and_movie_night_success.html</a></p>
<p>LoveLicton.com and Friends of Mineral Springs Park have partnered to put on monthly beginners disc golf events in the summer (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1516386398463215">https://www.facebook.com/events/1516386398463215</a>).</p>
<p><strong>4) Any additional clarifications?</strong></p>
<p>We will be submitting our application for 501(c)3 status this year. Additionally, we will be exploring a fiscal sponsor if our 501(c)3 status does not get approved in time. Licton Springs Community Council has non-profit status as registered in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Dear Relatives and Friends, \
 \
Enclosed is a draft of a letter of support from Licton Springs Community Council for Historic Landmark designation for Licton Springs Park for your review and, hopefully, approval. \
 \
Please contact me with any questions, comments, or suggestions.  I look forward to hearing from you. \
 \
Sincerely, \
 \

<p>To Whom it May Concern,</p>
<p>The Licton Springs Community Council is in full support of the listing of Licton Springs as a historic landmark through the Landmarks Preservation Board.</p>
<p>Located near North Seattle College in the Licton Springs neighborhood, Licton Springs is the remnant of one of the last remaining sacred sites of the Duwamish People.  The word "Licton" is derived from the Duwamish word <strong>líq'tәd </strong>(pronounced LEEK'tuhd) meaning "Red Paint", a connotation of the reddish colored iron oxide from the springs.</p>
<p>The springs served as a location for spiritual gatherings for the Duwamish People, where they would gather annually to build sweat-lodges for cleansing.  The red ochre pigment was also collected from the springs and used as a paint for different ceremonies and to decorate longhouses and other items with spiritual imagery.  The reddish-mud was also utilized as an ointment by traditional healers.</p>
<p>"<em>For generations, the Duwamish Tribe gathered at Licton Springs, together with their relatives by marriage, in the proper season for harvesting sacred Red Ochre pigment, necessary for spiritual celebration and renewal. Like the Duwamish Tribe, neighboring First Nations consider the sacred site <strong>líq'tәd</strong> to be a tangible cultural property inherited from their male or female Duwamish Ancestors. As a result of inter-marriage, neighboring First Nations have a material interest in access to and preservation of the sacred site <strong>líq'tәd</strong>.</em></p>
<p>_Licton Springs was a therapeutic resource for the Duwamish Tribe, who built a <strong>wúx̌təd </strong>("WUKH-tud", "sweat lodge", sweat-house) near the springs.  A <strong>wúx̌təd</strong> was used to cleanse and revitalize a person's spirit, as well as their body.  For spiritual gatherings and ceremonies, the Duwamish People painted their faces with RedLICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Minutes of Sept 19 2018</span></p>
<p>Meridian Center for Health, 10521 Meridian Ave. N., Seattle 98133</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Directors Present</span>:  Melanie Davies, Liz Kearns, Thomas Stachiw, Tim Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden.</p>
<p>Thomas convened the meeting by having everyone introduce themselves and talk about what issues they were interested in putting forth. A neighbor from 105<sup>th</sup> St expressed her concern about crime, drug use, prostitution in neighborhood.  Melanie offered to send her the anti-crime information Mary Amberg had provided at our June meeting. A representative from Seattle Neighborhood Group discussed the community safety survey going out regarding the 8800 block of Nesbit. Kathleen will send out the link to the listserv.</p>
<p>June 20, 2018 minutes and Treasurer's Report were approved.</p>
<p>Kathleen moved to spend approx. $78 for a banner for the Community Council to be used at neighborhood events. Seconded and approved.</p>
<p>Melanie discussed upcoming Halloween event in Licton Springs park and the need for Friends of the Forest volunteers.  Melanie would like to also interest Eagle Staff parents and students to help.  melanie requested $400 for cost o musicians, cider, and candy.  MindyLee Irvine also is putting together a map of safe trick or treating houses in the neighborhood.  Seconded and approved to spend the $400 requested.  Melanie will communicate with Emma Medicine Whitecrow of the Licton Springs neighborhood and schools to see if costs can be reduced by coordinating with the schools. Jan expressed a desire to see Native American representative images of animals at the event.  Emma also discussed the work at the schools and the hope to inspire and excite the children about tribal sovereignty of the land at Licton Springs park.</p>
<p>Thomas Speer of Urban Native Education Alliance made a presentation, explaining as well his role as an elder and his concern for Licton Springs' historic significance. He noted that the Duwamish people have been in the area for 15,000years because tribal traditions date back to the Ice Age.  He stated that there were originally three springs at the park: Sulphur, iron oxide, and magnesium.  As of today, only the iron oxide spring is intact. He expressed dismay about the graffiti, needles, trash, excrement, and prostitution in the park. He also noted the significance of the park to the David Denny family and that David Denny, unlike other Dennys, had been a friend to local Native Americans.  Speer spoke for a group that is advocating for designation of the park as a historic landmark, with accompanying signage to explain the historic significance of the park. LSCC is requested to write a letter supporting the designation, as noted by both Thomas Speer and other visitors present such as Matt Remle, who provided a notebook of information.</p>
<p>Emma called for more money for education directly, rather than, for example, the money spent on the Andrew Morrison murals.  There was a general discussion about designation of historic places in Licton Springs area.</p>
<p>Kathleen asked questions about the impact of a historic designation o the park management of the space and wants to be cautious about potentially negative interaction between City depts. that might inadvertently be harmful to use of the park. The group at the meeting also discussed federal recognition of tribes.  Melanie affirmed Liz's role as forest steward for the park. and Kathleen gave an update on a proposal underway to DON to upgrade the signage in the park (Kathleen, Liz, Emma, Amanda Culp, and Joseph are all on the committee).</p>
<p>melanie reported on ALUV and the moratorium on development along Aurora.  Home Zone- Greenways is also looking at ways to slow traffic in some areas around Licton Springs.  A recent meeting on the topic had good attendance and there is a survey link on the Love Licton blog.</p>
<p>Jan, Ellen, and Amada discussed 501 c 3 status restoration.  Amanda moved spending the $275 for reinstatement application. This was seconded and approved.</p>
<p>Jan brought up her dislike of the placement of portables at the new schools.</p>
<p>Meeting adjourned at 8:35. Minutes submitted by Kathleen Braden, secretary.</p>
<p>Next meeting Oct 17, 2018
 Ochre pigment, the reddish mud flowing from Licton Springs, and used the red pigment to decorate their longhouses and other objects with spiritual images. Healers administered herbs and soothed aching bodies with the red mud_.</p>
<p><strong><em>líq'tәd cannot be re-created, replaced, or re-located. Its importance is beyond measure and description, and its value is beyond price. The Duwamish People are the stewards of líq'tәd, other holy places and the natural endowment that dúkʷibəɬ (Creator) bestowed upon our ʔálʔaltəd</em></strong> <em>(Ancestral-Homeland).</em></p>
<p><em>At the beginning of time, <strong>líq'tәd</strong> ("Licton Springs") was given to us by <strong>dúkʷibəɬ</strong> (Creator) in perpetuity.  It is an inalienable part of our Patrimony, a legacy from our Ancestors, and the Cultural Heritage of the <strong>dx<sup>w</sup>'dəwɁábš </strong>(People-of-the-Inside), Chief Seattle's Duwamish Tribe</em>."</p>

<li><strong>l<span style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span>k<sup>w</sup>'<span style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span>lás </strong>(Place-of-the-Fire, Thomas Speer)</li>
</ul>
<p>Preservation of the springs as designated as a historic site is essential in the protection and the education of Seattle's First People, the Duwamish, as well as, the history of Seattle.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

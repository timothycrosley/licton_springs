&lt;p&gt;Meridian Center for Health, 10521 Meridian Ave. N., Seattle 98133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Directors Present&lt;/span&gt;:  Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, Tim Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Whittemore from DON visited the meeting, as well as Amanda Crosley.  The group had an informal discussion until 7:20 when an additional director joined us to from a quorum to do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes of Sept 19 2018 and Treasurer's report 9/1/2018 to 9/30/2018 were both approved as distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M/S/A that Licton Springs Community Council be a sponsor for the Arts in the Park proposal entitled "Outdoor Movie and Dog Party in Mineral Springs Park as authored by neighbor Amanda Crosley and distributed to Licton Springs Community Council members by email October 12, 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUTDOOR MOVIE &amp;amp; DOG PAWTY IN THE PARK 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Describe the activities of the festival, event, or project for which you are seeking funds. Include information about how arts and culture will be featured in your project or event. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event seeks to bring the community together over a free outdoor movie with booths for artists and vendors held in Mineral Springs Park. We are seeking funding for a movie public performance license, rental fees associated with a movie screen, generator, projector, marketing materials and for a port-a-potty as Mineral Springs Park does not have any public restrooms or electrical outlets. Our event will occur on a Saturday during the summer from 6 PM to 10 PM with art activities and community games held from 6 PM to 8 PM and the outdoor movie starting at sunset around 8 PM. If we receive AIP funding, the additional funds will go towards incentivizing more artists to attend, live music, children's activities (face painting, chalk, coloring, etc.) and towards increased marketing as we have found that lawn signs are very effective in previous events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Describe who will attend your event. How does your project use arts and culture to build community. Describe what your efforts will be to reach diversity populations and increase accessibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target audience for our event is the local community around Mineral Springs Park. We will leverage translated flyers and movie subtitles to increase the accessibility of our event. The movie will explore an under-represented culture such as Hispanic or Latino (ex: Coco) and be free and open to the public. We will seek out local businesses and artists for vendor spots at our event with a focus on diversity. For example, we will connect with North Seattle Community College (including the Licton Springs Review) and their Diversity Advisory Committee to reach out to students.We will also reach out to local organizations such as Epic Life Church, Aurora Licton Urban Village (ALUV) and Aurora Commons to increase our reach. Additionally, we will hand deliver flyers to transit centers, community centers, libraries, and other neighborhood gathering spots to reach those without internet access and connect with low-income neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Provide a brief history of your arts programming and presenting activities. What evidence can you provide of your capacity to produce this event successfully. Describe any key partnerships. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs Community Council hosts annual events for the community such as the Licton Springs Halloween Walk (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/308149439973556/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/308149439973556/&lt;/a&gt;) and monthly events such as Friends of Licton Springs work parties (&lt;a href="https://lictonsprings.org/work_party.pdf"&gt;https://lictonsprings.org/work_party.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). Licton Springs Community Council will be partnering with LoveLicton.com and Friends of Mineral Springs Park to host this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LoveLicton.com partnered with the Seattle Parks &amp;amp; Recreation department last summer, 2018, to put on this event. We had 4 vendors, 12 sponsors, and over 50 attendees. We hope to expand this event even further.

&lt;p&gt;LoveLicton.com and Friends of Mineral Springs Park have partnered to put on monthly beginners disc golf events in the summer (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1516386398463215"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/1516386398463215&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Any additional clarifications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be submitting our application for 501(c)3 status this year. Additionally, we will be exploring a fiscal sponsor if our 501(c)3 status does not get approved in time. Licton Springs Community Council has non-profit status as registered in the State of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melanie reported on the upcoming Halloween event; Kathleen reported on progress ordering a Banner for events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group discussed the UNEA request for a support letter for the historic status proposed for Licton Springs Park. The model letter from Tom Speer is attached below. Kathleen reported on responses from Erin Doherty of Landmarks Board and group decided more information was needed before a letter of support could be offered.  Kathleen will circulate a draft email to Mr. Speer and, if no objections, will email it to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie and Tim reported on ALUC meeting of October 11 and factors affecting closure in March 2019 of the Aurora-Licton "tiny house" homeless village. Thomas Whittemore provided some prospectives from City viewpoint.  Melanie also noted the upcoming installation of art on the Aurora pedestrian overpass.  here was also discussion at the ALUV meeting about longer run hopes for a community center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan asked Thomas about City criteria respecting derelict or nuisance property, expressing concern about Handy Andy on Aurora.  Thomas suggested contacting the owner and adopting t first a collaborative approach to improving clean up on the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group discussed the prospect of an Art Walk for the neighborhood in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen reported on the September D% Network sponsorship of a public forum on the budget with Debora Juarez, Ben Noble, and Kirsten Arestad.  The group discussed the upcoming change in the triangle green space near the North Precinct building as the area is asphalted for a parking lot.

&lt;p&gt;Meeting adjourned at 8:40. Minutes submitted by Kathleen Braden, secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next meeting Nov. 14, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATTACHMENT- proposed letter from Thomas Speer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Relatives and Friends, \
 \
Enclosed is a draft of a letter of support from Licton Springs Community Council for Historic Landmark designation for Licton Springs Park for your review and, hopefully, approval. \
 \
Please contact me with any questions, comments, or suggestions.  I look forward to hearing from you. \
 \
Sincerely, \
 \
Tom Speer \

Licton Springs Protector \
Member, Elders Advisory Council, Urban Native Education Alliance (UNEA) \

&lt;p&gt;To Whom it May Concern,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Licton Springs Community Council is in full support of the listing of Licton Springs as a historic landmark through the Landmarks Preservation Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located near North Seattle College in the Licton Springs neighborhood, Licton Springs is the remnant of one of the last remaining sacred sites of the Duwamish People.  The word "Licton" is derived from the Duwamish word &lt;strong&gt;líq'tәd &lt;/strong&gt;(pronounced LEEK'tuhd) meaning "Red Paint", a connotation of the reddish colored iron oxide from the springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The springs served as a location for spiritual gatherings for the Duwamish People, where they would gather annually to build sweat-lodges for cleansing.  The red ochre pigment was also collected from the springs and used as a paint for different ceremonies and to decorate longhouses and other items with spiritual imagery.  The reddish-mud was also utilized as an ointment by traditional healers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;For generations, the Duwamish Tribe gathered at Licton Springs, together with their relatives by marriage, in the proper season for harvesting sacred Red Ochre pigment, necessary for spiritual celebration and renewal. Like the Duwamish Tribe, neighboring First Nations consider the sacred site &lt;strong&gt;líq'tәd&lt;/strong&gt; to be a tangible cultural property inherited from their male or female Duwamish Ancestors. As a result of inter-marriage, neighboring First Nations have a material interest in access to and preservation of the sacred site &lt;strong&gt;líq'tәd&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Licton Springs was a therapeutic resource for the Duwamish Tribe, who built a &lt;strong&gt;wúx̌təd &lt;/strong&gt;("WUKH-tud", "sweat lodge", sweat-house) near the springs.  A &lt;strong&gt;wúx̌təd&lt;/strong&gt; was used to cleanse and revitalize a person's spirit, as well as their body.  For spiritual gatherings and ceremonies, the Duwamish People painted their faces with RedLICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meridian Center for Health, 10521 Meridian Ave. N., Seattle 98133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Directors Present&lt;/span&gt;:  Melanie Davies, Liz Kearns, Thomas Stachiw, Tim Crosley, Jan Brucker, and Kathleen Braden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas convened the meeting by having everyone introduce themselves and talk about what issues they were interested in putting forth. A neighbor from 105&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; St expressed her concern about crime, drug use, prostitution in neighborhood.  Melanie offered to send her the anti-crime information Mary Amberg had provided at our June meeting. A representative from Seattle Neighborhood Group discussed the community safety survey going out regarding the 8800 block of Nesbit. Kathleen will send out the link to the listserv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 20, 2018 minutes and Treasurer's Report were approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen moved to spend approx. $78 for a banner for the Community Council to be used at neighborhood events. Seconded and approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie discussed upcoming Halloween event in Licton Springs park and the need for Friends of the Forest volunteers.  Melanie would like to also interest Eagle Staff parents and students to help.  melanie requested $400 for cost o musicians, cider, and candy.  MindyLee Irvine also is putting together a map of safe trick or treating houses in the neighborhood.  Seconded and approved to spend the $400 requested.  Melanie will communicate with Emma Medicine Whitecrow of the Licton Springs neighborhood and schools to see if costs can be reduced by coordinating with the schools. Jan expressed a desire to see Native American representative images of animals at the event.  Emma also discussed the work at the schools and the hope to inspire and excite the children about tribal sovereignty of the land at Licton Springs park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Speer of Urban Native Education Alliance made a presentation, explaining as well his role as an elder and his concern for Licton Springs' historic significance. He noted that the Duwamish people have been in the area for 15,000years because tribal traditions date back to the Ice Age.  He stated that there were originally three springs at the park: Sulphur, iron oxide, and magnesium.  As of today, only the iron oxide spring is intact. He expressed dismay about the graffiti, needles, trash, excrement, and prostitution in the park. He also noted the significance of the park to the David Denny family and that David Denny, unlike other Dennys, had been a friend to local Native Americans.  Speer spoke for a group that is advocating for designation of the park as a historic landmark, with accompanying signage to explain the historic significance of the park. LSCC is requested to write a letter supporting the designation, as noted by both Thomas Speer and other visitors present such as Matt Remle, who provided a notebook of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma called for more money for education directly, rather than, for example, the money spent on the Andrew Morrison murals.  There was a general discussion about designation of historic places in Licton Springs area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen asked questions about the impact of a historic designation o the park management of the space and wants to be cautious about potentially negative interaction between City depts. that might inadvertently be harmful to use of the park. The group at the meeting also discussed federal recognition of tribes.  Melanie affirmed Liz's role as forest steward for the park. and Kathleen gave an update on a proposal underway to DON to upgrade the signage in the park (Kathleen, Liz, Emma, Amanda Culp, and Joseph are all on the committee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;melanie reported on ALUV and the moratorium on development along Aurora.  Home Zone- Greenways is also looking at ways to slow traffic in some areas around Licton Springs.  A recent meeting on the topic had good attendance and there is a survey link on the Love Licton blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan, Ellen, and Amada discussed 501 c 3 status restoration.  Amanda moved spending the $275 for reinstatement application. This was seconded and approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan brought up her dislike of the placement of portables at the new schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting adjourned at 8:35. Minutes submitted by Kathleen Braden, secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next meeting Oct 17, 2018
 Ochre pigment, the reddish mud flowing from Licton Springs, and used the red pigment to decorate their longhouses and other objects with spiritual images. Healers administered herbs and soothed aching bodies with the red mud_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;líq'tәd cannot be re-created, replaced, or re-located. Its importance is beyond measure and description, and its value is beyond price. The Duwamish People are the stewards of líq'tәd, other holy places and the natural endowment that dúkʷibəɬ (Creator) bestowed upon our ʔálʔaltəd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ancestral-Homeland).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the beginning of time, &lt;strong&gt;líq'tәd&lt;/strong&gt; ("Licton Springs") was given to us by &lt;strong&gt;dúkʷibəɬ&lt;/strong&gt; (Creator) in perpetuity.  It is an inalienable part of our Patrimony, a legacy from our Ancestors, and the Cultural Heritage of the &lt;strong&gt;dx&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;'dəwɁábš &lt;/strong&gt;(People-of-the-Inside), Chief Seattle's Duwamish Tribe&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;'&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;lás &lt;/strong&gt;(Place-of-the-Fire, Thomas Speer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preservation of the springs as designated as a historic site is essential in the protection and the education of Seattle's First People, the Duwamish, as well as, the history of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introductions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes Jan. 16 , 2019 were approved as distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letter from Tim Motzer to Debora Juarez from Lake City Neighborhood Alliance (attached) asking for the Council's endorsement. Directors discussed it and had questions about the fee structure and asked Kathleen to send note to Tim declining but that we hope in the future to have a discussion on MHA and fees with other community groups such as LCNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As FYI, Kathleen provided map of MHA zooning proposals and list of amendments that are up for vote in March by City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion of Handy Andy business on Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda brought up Your Voice Your Choice request for proposals deadline approaching Feb 22 and the Neighborhood Street Fund program with votes due soon on proposals for Licton Springs and adjacent areas  Kathleen will send out to listserv remainder for people to go online and vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group discussed various techniques used by SDOT and DON that creates competition and even "popularity contests" among competing projects proposed by citizens.  Melanie suggested a letter about District Five being poorer than other districts in terms of sidewalks. Kathleen updated the group on proposal to improve signage in Licton Springs Park and her frustration with DON processes when this should merely be part of regular Parks maintenance schedule. She noted her intention to cease efforts to make a DON large grants proposal and will inform the d-hoc committee brought together in the fall, as well as PNA who had agreed to serve as sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda noted we did not get picked for the Arts in the Park projects and will explore other possibilities.  She will be looking into various grant options like Small Sparks and Neighborhood Matching Funds.  Kathleen suggested that any money LSCC had agreed to set aside from our parks fund for signage in Licton Springs Park might be redirected as matching seed money for the Arts or event projects Amanda is thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie noted that Epic Life Church might do another Celebrate North Seattle event. It might be good to invite someone from the church to our next meeting. She also discussed ALUV efforts to do a zoning change from commercial to neighborhood-commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed the Home Zone project, SDOT, data on traffic measurement and Ed Irwin applying for speed bumps for traffic calming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie noted the Aurora pedestrian bridge artwork is now up and the daffodils planted there will soon be blooming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen noted that City Council District Five candidate John Lombard had indicated a desire to be at one of our meetings and the group noted he is welcome to come and listen but we have not had a tradition of inviting candidates in for their campaign promotions.  Kathleen will email him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes by Kathleen Braden, secretary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next meeting is our general membership meeting March 20.&lt;/p&gt;

He also noted the significance of the park to the David Denny family and that David Denny, unlike other Dennys, had been a friend to local Native Americans.  Speer spoke for a group that is advocating for designation of the park as a historic landmark, with accompanying signage to explain the historic significance of the park. LSCC is requested to write a letter supporting the designation, as noted by both Thomas Speer and other visitors present such as Matt Remle, who provided a notebook of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma called for more money for education directly, rather than, for example, the money spent on the Andrew Morrison murals.  There was a general discussion about designation of historic places in Licton Springs area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen asked questions about the impact of a historic designation o the park management of the space and wants to be cautious about potentially negative interaction between City depts. that might inadvertently be harmful to use of the park. The group at the meeting also discussed federal recognition of tribes.  Melanie affirmed Liz's role as forest steward for the park. and Kathleen gave an update on a proposal underway to DON to upgrade the signage in the park (Kathleen, Liz, Emma, Amanda Culp, and Joseph are all on the committee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;melanie reported on ALUV and the moratorium on development along Aurora.  Home Zone- Greenways is also looking at ways to slow traffic in some areas around Licton Springs.  A recent meeting on the topic had good attendance and there is a survey link on the Love Licton blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan, Ellen, and Amada discussed 501 c 3 status restoration.  Amanda moved spending the $275 for reinstatement application. This was seconded and approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan brought up her dislike of the placement of portables at the new schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas convened the meeting at 6:40 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasurer's Report and minutes of May 16, 2018 were approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Culp presented an initial proposal to establish a dog off-leash area in Mineral Springs Park, following the City of Seattle guidelines for making a proposal (which Amanda and Tim Crosley distributed, along with a map of the park and location of other areas). Melanie suggested giving the Park Meridian residents a heads up. M/S/A that Licton Springs Community Council be a sponsoring organization to move ahead with the proposal to create an off-leash area in Mineral Springs Park per application process with Seattle Dept. of Parks &amp;amp; Recreation and include public outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Mary Amberg&lt;/span&gt;, Seattle Police Department Crime Prevention Coordinator made a presentation on neighborhood safety.  Mary explained her role, the role of David Gordon, community police team coordinator for our area, and the services they can provide. She showed a map explaining the boundaries and outlined the various issues David deals with in the neighborhood.  Visitors from the community asked questions with concerns about safety and police response when 911 Is called.  Mary explained the 911 prioritization system and noted that the police &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; respond but they might not come in person other than a drive-by survey unless a "request contact" phrase is used by caller to actually have an officer come to the door. Mary discussed the Navigation Tea, and outreach, cleanup of homeless camps, the use of the Find It-Fix It application, and the best way to report campers.  She reviewed the statistics for the N3 beat within the North Precinct where Licton Springs is located. She urged people not to leave &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; in cars because of car prowls. The current plan for the North Precinct building was discussed. She noted the LEAD program (Law Enforcement Aided Diversion) is coming to the precinct and officers are in training now. More officer shave been budgeted for patrols around the Aurora Encampment. She provided "Smart 911" cards from King County for people who might want their information to be recorded since there is currently not a way for an exact location to be tracked just from a cell phone. &lt;a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/it/e-911-program/smart-911.aspx"&gt;https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/it/e-911-program/smart-911.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary noted that one can call the North Precinct and put in a "request to watch" for neighborhood or house and, provided the officer has time, it will be done on a regular basis.  She noted that King County keeps the sex registry and a map for the Licton Springs neighborhood can be seen online [https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/sheriff/sex-offender-search.aspx]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Licton Springs Web Page&lt;/span&gt;- Timothy showed us the proposed new web page for the Licton Springs Community Council which includes archived existing page.  He and Amanda had also scanned in old copies of &lt;em&gt;Currents&lt;/em&gt; and added a link, as well as a link to the North Precinct, things to do in the neighborhood, green space, discussion page, community calendar, and many other features.  The Licton Springs Community Council members complimented Tim &amp;amp; Amanda on it. M/S/A to commission Tim to go ahead with it and Kathleen will put him in contact with Lisa Henry to get codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Lee Bruch on Aurora Coalition, D5 plans-&lt;/span&gt; The May 31 forum sponsored by D5 with at-large City Council representatives went well, with about 150 people attending. In July, there will be vehicle-tours of District Five neighborhoods with Mosqueda and González over a two day period, July 27 (Northgate and Lake City) and July 31 (Licton Springs, Haller Lake, Bitter Lake).  Lee called for docents to help with the tour and make presentations at various stops, as well as assistance with handouts. Both ALUV and Licton Springs should participate. Jan suggested Liz for the park and discussed issues related to City Light land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then discussed concerns about plans for the North Precinct police station (portables, new parking area).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was adjourned at 8:40 PM.  Notes submitted by Kathleen Braden, Secretary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas convened the meeting at 6:40 PM. People attending introduced themselves and explained issues they were interested in including park safety, cleanliness of neighborhood, school lighting, crime prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasurer's Report: Ellen noted a few items, such as the fact she paid the InMotion web hosting bill and filed the 99n from with the IRS and deposited two membership checks. The Treasurer's Report for April 1-30 2018 was approved as distributed. M/S/A the minutes of April 4, 2018 as distributed by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lou-Anne Daoust-Filiatrault from Seattle Public Utilities visited and presented information on an SPU pilot Litter Abatement Program.  Licton Springs will be the next neighborhood chosen for the program.  Two workers clean litter from Aurora Avenue and some nearby streets twice per week on Tuesdays and Fridays. Licton Springs was chosen as a result of the number of issues raised by residents to the City. The litter cleaning cannot be done in parks or on private property under this program. SPU also hopes to expand in the future the number of sharps disposal containers available since there are only eight city-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs and Mineral Springs Parks- Randy Wiger of City Parks &amp;amp; Recreation is holding two more public meetings, June 5 and July 3 and trying to get more people from disc golf community to attend.  Joseph reported on the recent work party in Licton Springs park. Kathleen noted the cordoning off around the restroom is due to roof and skylight repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M/S/A Kathleen will send a letter to Parks &amp;amp; Recreation Dept requesting that pet waste station be added to Licton Springs park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications task force: Joseph, Timothy, Tom Meyer, and Kathleen met May 8 and decided four points as recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that Licton Springs Community Council move its web outreach to the Love Licton blog managed by Tim and Amanda Crosley with the current Licton Springs Community Council website archived and still available via the blog.  Retain symbols for Licton Springs Community Council as cat-tail. Tim and Amanda will do a prototype that can be shown at June 20 meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to initiate a campaign to get out more knowledge throughout the neighborhood of Licton Springs Community Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make bulletin board in Licton Springs Park more prominent, perhaps move near restroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph is on sustainability committee for North Seattle College and will work with that group on community outreach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs Community Council approved having a table at Debora Juarez's Live in D5 event June 30. Melanie and Kathleen can provide labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Bruch presented information on a proposed Aurora Coalition and a draft of a letter to the City with information about safety concerns and steps for action had been circulated by email in draft form.  Lee is visiting different neighborhood groups to develop support for the coalition. Lee would like Licton Springs Community Council to join, to support the letter, and appoint a person to liaison with the coalition. After discussion, concern was raised that some missing Board members would want to vote on the request, so it is delayed until the June 20 meeting, but Thomas asked that an email discussion be generated among Board members. M/S/A meanwhile to authorize this statement for Lee with permission to use it: &lt;em&gt;The Licton Springs Community Council agrees with the conclusions raised by Lee Bruch on behalf of the Aurora Coalition and appreciates the proposed action steps in principle.  We will vote at our June 20, 2018 meeting on joining the coalition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the meeting then were invited to discuss some of their concerns and Lori Bienhoff discussed the lighting decision by Seattle Public Schools and the neighborhood meeting (which Melanie, Liz, Joseph also attended). The issue of access to the playfields at the Cascadia and RESMS schools was also discussed. Dissatisfaction was expressed that the School district would proceed with the lighting despite any opposition from the neighborhood. Lee Bruch offered materials from the (failed) attempt to get lighting controlled at Blanchet H.S. a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanie noted that Mary Amberg of the Seattle Police Dept agreed to attend the Licton Springs Community Council June 20 meeting and Kathleen will make sure it is advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Crosley said she is very interested in helping with any community events and Kathleen will put her in touch with Jan Brucker who could not be here this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was adjourned at 8:35 PM.

Minutes of April 4 2018
Meridian Center for Health, 10521 Meridian Ave. N., Seattle 98133
Directors Present: Jan Brucker, Liz Kearns, Melanie Davies, Tom Meyer, and Kathleen Braden.
Jan convened the meeting at 6:30 PM. People attending introduced themselves.
Dave Kunkel, who has done so much to preserve Pillings Pond and its waterfowl, visited and
made a brief report on the property. He noted the section with the pond has been a designated
wetland and requires much upkeep. The property sold recently for $650,000. Dave has been
feeding and caring for over 100 fowl, mainly wood ducks (see photo), many of which he has
raised. Dave reviewed the history of the property since several people had come to the
meeting to show interest in it. He noted the family that purchased the property has an interest
in ducks, but most likely will be renting out the house. Dave is continuing to manage the
property. Jan reviewed past efforts, particularly by Dave Barber and neighborhood groups to
keep it preserved. The Parks Dept. does not seem inclined to take it on. There was a
suggestion to revive Friends of Pillings Pond as in the past, there had been non-profit status
for a group with that name. A neighbor who was attending out of interest in the property,
indicated she might like to help with that effort. Kathleen will send her contact information for
others who have been involved in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Bruch made a presentation on Aurora Avenue and noted that it is a good
time to consider future improvements. Lee is hoping to create a coalition of
north end groups who have a stake in the corridor and has already approached
many neighborhood groups such as Haller Lake, Green lake, Bitter Lake,
Greenwood, ALUV. Part of the impetus came from a recent series of stories on KUOW radio
about the corridor. Lee has also been asked to write something for “The Urbanist”. The group
reviewed past efforts and asked Lee some questions about role of WSDOT, evolution of
thinking on the part of businesses along Aurora. A re-paving project will occur summer of
2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[secretary’s note: see list of District Five 2018 street and utility projects at D5 Projects 2018]
Spring event- Melanie noted ALUV liked the idea of a garage sale event, perhaps for school
parking lots. Jan also presented information on the Seattle Symphonic Band at North Seattle
College. A possibility of music in the park and budget was briefly discussed in an
introductory, exploratory way (no details).
The Council noted the March 26 meeting on Licton Village low barrier encampment and an
interest in the community on crime rates. There was also an analysis on crime rates nearby
done on NextDoor. [secretary note- Draft Minutes Community Advisory Meeting March 22
2018]
The minutes of March 21 2018 were presented and Joseph had several corrections, so he will
send them to Kathleen and the minutes can be approved. The Treasurer’s Report of March
2018 was approved.
Vote on Board Members: Per Articles VII and VIII of the Licton Springs Community Council
By-Laws, the following people, having been nominated at the March 2018 meeting, were voted
on and approved for terms through April 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joseph Amann&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ellen Beck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jan Brucker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie Davies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liz Kearns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accord with Article VII-4 on filling a vacancy, the Board elected as a member Tim Crosley
and his term will run through April of 2018 as well.
M/S/Unanimous approval to thank Tom Meyer who has served for many years. Tom
indicate he will still be available to assist with improving communication for the Council.
Officers- elected by the Board are as follows:
Thomas Stachiw – President
Joseph Amann- Vice-President
Kathleen Braden – Secretary
Ellen Beck-Treasurer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liz Kearns gave an update on Licton Springs and Mineral Springs Parks, including how to
report campers in the parks to the City. The April 3 meeting with Randy Wiger of Parks Dept
on Mineral Springs Park had not been very well attended, possibly due to poor publicity.
There is a hope to get the disk golfing community more involved in future meetings.
Melanie Davies will contact Mary Amberg of Seattle Police Dept to see if she could attend a
June meeting on safety issues. Jan noted that we are lacking a representative to the Seattle
Police Advisory Committee and that Birgit Ardea might be interested in this service and Jan
will contact her about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was adjourned at 8:35 PM.

&lt;p&gt;Robin Amadon and Aisaya Corbray from Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) made a presentation on plans for a mixed income structure on Aurora Avenue at the Nesbit site where the tiny house village was located until this year.  LIHI envisions a seven-story structure and 118 units (see attachment). If all goes well, LIHI is hoping to have it opened by spring 2022.  Robin discussed funding sources, design, and plan for mixed types.  Parking will  not be provided but LIHI hopes to attract people who use non-automobile forms of traffic.  She also discussed ways to secure the walls until construction can start to discourage tagging.  LIHI would like future help from LSCC in announcing public meetings as the project proceeds.  Kathleen will email Robin and Aisaya the email addresses for the LSCC directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Blumhagen, who is a candidate for the Seattle School Board, visited and discussed some of the issues he feels are most important and asked for input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Whittemore of the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods discussed the City’s efforts to ensure a good rate of participation for the upcoming 2020 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah Andersen from ALUV vii\sited and discussed the meeting held recently with Debora Juarez and efforts to find funding for a feasibility study for an Aurora-Licton Springs Community Center.  She noted possible availability of a parcel where Quiring Monuments are currently located on Aurora. There will be an upcoming budget discussion and D. Juarez has proposed funding for the study and Leah would like to see support from the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M/S/A &lt;em&gt;he Licton Springs Community Council supports the efforts of Debora Juarez to secure funding for a feasibility study to create a community center for the Aurora-Licton Springs area. The LSCC will continue to monitor this issue and communicate progress to our neighborhood email list of residents and via other social media platforms&lt;/em&gt;. Kathleen will send to the City Council and to Deputy Mayor Moseley and post to the Licton Springs Facebook page, send to email list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group discussed various assignments for Board members that came out of the Sept Board retreat. Amanda, Janice, and Kathleen will follow up re a survey of residents and also Kathleen will post notes from the retreat unless she hears any objections by email before Oct 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice reported on communications with schools and North Seattle College. The group discussed plans for a residential facility at the college (which may be delayed) and the one year extension of the P-Patch on the college grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megan Hazen gave us addresses for parent groups from Cascadia and Eagle Staff schools and said that development of regular communication would be good between the PTAs and the LSCC: &lt;a href="mailto:communications@Cascadiapta.org"&gt;communications@Cascadiapta.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:info@eaglestaffptsa.org"&gt;info@eaglestaffptsa.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It will make the park the only Native American site in the City so designated.    Janice will send a congratulations message to Urban Native Education Alliance people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas presented ideas on signage to solicit people who might be interested in joining the Board and Kathleen discussed the possibility of having an Advisory Board for the Community Council. The group also agreed to set up a “who we are” part of our website to identify Board members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas will be leaving the Board after December and Lindsey Webb was unanimously approved to be appointed to fill in Thomas’s term per Article VII-4 of by-laws. [^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice closed the meeting at 8:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

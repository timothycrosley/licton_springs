&lt;h1&gt;What is a P-Patch?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P-Patch is the name given to community gardens that are managed by the Seattle P-Patch Community Gardening Program. The P-Patch program oversees 88 P-Patches over 32 acres throughout the city. Though a P-Patch, neighbors can come together to plan, plant, and grow community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is the history of Licton Spring's P-Patch?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Licton Springs P-Patch dates back to 1976 as a student-driven initiative at North Seattle College. While the original community garden ended up as a school parking lot, in 2013 the North Seattle College Sustainability Committee revived the initiative. After over a year of hard work from the community digging up land, building plots, and adding compost, a community garden of 67 plots and 15,000 sq ft was developed in Licton Springs! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How can I get involved?&lt;/h1&gt;

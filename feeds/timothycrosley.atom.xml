This next Tuesday (the 19th, a week and some change from now) at 6:30 PM we will be holding our first beginner's disc golf game, with help from members of the local disc golf community. At this event, you will not only be able to learn how to play alongside other beginners but will also be able to receive valuable tips from some more veteran disc golf players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/mineral_springs/disc/course.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Course Map" src="images/mineral_springs/disc/course.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be held at Mineral Springs park, located on the north end of Licton Springs. This course takes the honor of being the original and only Disc Golf course in Seattle proper. Being a city course it also has a more compact intricate design making it uniquely well suited to learning disc golf technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/mineral_springs/disc/steps.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Steps" src="images/mineral_springs/disc/steps.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="images/mineral_springs/disc/hole_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hole 6" src="images/mineral_springs/disc/hole_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having never Disc Golfed ourselves, my wife and I went by the course this morning to get some sense of the game. In the course, we were struck by not only the beauty and tranquillity of a course nestled in the city but also by the friendliness of disc golfers. We ran into Mary and Tony who took us through both some of the basics of Disc Golf and the unique traits of this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/mineral_springs/disc/mary_and_tony.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mary and Tony" src="images/mineral_springs/disc/mary_and_tony.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are poles throughout the course used to hold up netting that separates pathways and different sections of the course.
They told us that every time your disc hits one of those poles and makes a little ringing sound, it's called North Park Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/mineral_springs/disc/poles.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="North park love" src="images/mineral_springs/disc/poles.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to enjoy the summer weather, learn how to Disc Golf, and ring in some North Park Love with some of you there!&lt;/p&gt;

Regardless what your thoughts are on the overall legislation, I encourage you to let our council members know what we as a community want from Aurora. For me that means more gems like the wonderful neighborhood shops that fill Oak Tree Plaza and fewer storage facilities. Either way, as the final public hearing happens tomorrow (June 5th) this may be your last opportunity to let the council know how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From our friends at &lt;a href="http://auroralictonuv.org/"&gt;ALUV&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear ALUV Friends and Neighbors, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for continued interest in bringing positive change to the Aurora Ave Corridor, specifically from N. 84th to N. 110th. As we continue our efforts to increase public safety via “eyes on the street” our biggest obstacle is the commercial zoning designation. This zoning has recently allowed for two public storage facilities to be built that provide no housing or walkable amenities to our Residential Urban Village as designated by the city in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please email your support for the proposed zoning changes from Commercial (C) to Neighborhood Commercial (NC) to the Seattle City Council &lt;a href="mailto: council@seattle.gov"&gt;council@seattle.gov&lt;/a&gt; prior to JUNE 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

In more ways than one, positive changes are starting to take hold on this historical Seattle Avenue. The city's proactive litter abatement pilot program &lt;a href="http://komonews.com/news/local/pro-active-litter-teams-patrolling-six-seattle-neighborhoods"&gt;has added Licton Spring's stretch of Aurora&lt;/a&gt; to its 2x weekly cleanup. This brave crew cleans up everything from coffee cups to used syringes, hopefully helping to encourage a sustainably clean street over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, SPD and Licton Spring's own North Precinct have been hard at work to bust a local pawn shop that incentivised theft within North Seattle. Along with the closure of the business, this had the side effect of finally permanently removing an Aurora fixture that we will all be happy to see go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/aurora/rare_coins.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aurora Lady Statue" src="images/aurora/rare_coins.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/SR99/RoySt145thPaving/default.htm"&gt;Aurora is going to be repaved and sidewalk ramps made ADA compliant over the next year&lt;/a&gt;. Which, while sure to be an inconvenience during construction and &lt;a href="http://kuow.org/post/state-repaving-aurora-thats-chance-build-sidewalks-no"&gt;lacking the sidewalk improvements Aurora desperately needs&lt;/a&gt;, will hopefully be worth it upon completion as it plays a part in increasing road safety and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more work is needed along this historic stretch of Seattle, it's encouraging that we are starting to see progress toward an Aurora that we can all take pride in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “tuxedo” cat, Henry, known by his stage name, Henri, Le Chat Noir, is a resident of our
neighborhood, though he lives in quiet obscurity, not troubled by his You-Tube fame. He plays the role
of a depressed, French cat in a series of videos that have garnered millions of viewers. Henry has over
170,000 Facebook followers and has been featured on Animal Planet and in People magazine. Henry also
has two books out on his philosophy and a Wikipedia page. But no French Riviera for this feline! “I love
Licton”, says Henry, “it’s the best place in the world for a spoiled, handsome cat.”&lt;/p&gt;

The art not only serves as a sign of nicer weather, as flowers bloom from Tesla's head but also serves as a great reminder that technology and
nature can coexist in harmony. In a way, it's the perfect Seattle art piece, a city nestled in some of the most profoundly beautiful natural
environments while leading the way in our technological future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rushing to the restaurant after work, I was greeted not by Tropicos Breeze, but by El Patio. What a quick transformation! Entering El Patio, I saw familiar faces and after talking to the staff learned what had taken place. The Licton Spring's Tropicos Breeze location was sold to the owner's cousin. The new restaurant, I was told, retains the same staff and great quality food we have come to love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered Pollo en Crema and Horchata - two of my favorite standbys from the old Tropicos Breeze. You know, just to make sure I was told the truth...
And I can happily confirm: the food here is as tasty as ever!&lt;/p&gt;

It already has relatively high side-walk coverage and population density for the North Seattle area. It is also full of pro-growth and housing community groups - with no noticeable Nimby presence. And, with the light rail approaching in a few more years, it appears the community will be well positioned to take on the growth it desires. The neighbourhood has been seeing additional improvements planned and completed at an unprecedented pace. It's hard just to keep track of all the projects going on! To try and make it a bit easier: I've gone ahead and taken inventory of all the projects I'm aware of and mapped them out by location, start time, and end time.&lt;/p&gt;

In any case, we certainly have an exciting few years to look forward to! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Improvements"></category><category term="Transit"></category><category term="School"></category></entry><entry><title>Hidden in urban Seattle a nearly 100 year old duck oasis lives on</title><link href="/pillings-pond.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-25T01:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-25T01:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>timothycrosley</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-25:/pillings-pond.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the weather gets nicer - if you find yourself wanting to see some ducks you may think the best place to do so would be Green Lake or one of Seattle's many parks.

However, the best place to catch a glimpse of the local duck population in Seattle is right here in Licton Springs. Located on N 90th St between Densmore and Ashworth Ave N and near the new school: Pilling's Pond remains as a reminder of Chuck Pilling's legacy. This is the spot where he became the first successful breeder of the hooded merganser, bufflehead and harlequin ducks. Here you can still find hundreds of ducks enjoying the pond. While there has been some concern about the future of the pond due to a sale, the new owners have expressed their desire to keep the legacy going and have allowed Dave Kunkle to continue the maintenance of this great North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You can't enter the pond but can safely view the ducks from behind the wired fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college has expressed approval with the new design alleviating concerns that disagreements would lead to no bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new design decreases costs and the maximum slope while improving visibility and addressing the concerns of North Seattle College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has secured all necessary funding contingent on it being complete before the light rail opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take 10-15 minutes to walk from the base of the bridge to the entrance of the transit center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge will incorporate scenic overlooks and art installation(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no bike/pedestrian or direction lane separation planned for the bridge. Instead, users will be expected to utilize the generously wide (16ft) path to follow standard right of way rules. Additionally, visual and tactile cues will be added near mixing areas, transition zones, and overlooks providing helpful cues to bicyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIA Architecture expressed pride in their work to create an affordable design that will still be an enjoyable experience to walk over, highlight the beauty inherit on both sides of I5, and act as another North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with Eric from VIA Architecture, I learned that they use VR to verify what a realistic experience of their designs will be once built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned about a ton of other exciting things planned for Licton Springs and the surrounding area that will be rolling out over the next few years. Expect a follow-up post with a full overview of all these changes and when we can expect them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Transportation"></category><category term="Pedestrian"></category></entry><entry><title>A new bridge is set to bring two Seattle neighbourhoods closer together</title><link href="/pedestrian-bridge-updates.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-14T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-14T07:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>timothycrosley</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-14:/pedestrian-bridge-updates.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs is set to feel even more connected to Maple Leaf and the rest of the Northgate area.

With the construction of a pedestrian bridge on 100th, you will never have to walk more than 5 minutes North or South to cross over I5 and into Maple Leaf. This bridge is set to complement the existing Northgate Way underpass, 92nd overpass, and nearby 80th overpass directly connecting Licton Springs to the Northgate Transit Station and upcoming light rail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/bridge/i5_routes.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Existing routes over I5" src="/images/bridge/i5_routes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge is proposed to be built at the north end of North Seattle College, giving it a straight path over to the transit center:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/bridge/100th.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Proposed location" src="/images/bridge/100th.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There are also 3 upcoming opportunities to give feedback on the project before construction begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Wed. 3.21.18, 5-6:30 PM | Neighborcare Health at Meridian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In related news, at the same time as the bridge will be under construction, it seems likely an improved Northgate Mall will also be underway to welcome us upon completion:&lt;/p&gt;

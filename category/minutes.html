                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>approved Minutes June 19, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, Ellen Beck, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Susan Ward, Janice Holkup, Mike Cuadra, Mehul Shah, Dianne Trani, Sharon Bruce</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:35 and welcomed everyone.</p>
<p>At our invitation, Susan ward of ReVisioning Northgate, attended and updated LSCC on activities around the Northgate area and actions taken by RN. She noted it was formed at grassroots level to advocate for green spaces and livable spaces and includes representatives from various on-profits as well as residents and businesses. The group discussed transportation issues, the underpass beneath I-5 at Northgate, METRO and its projects, including bus staging areas, parking impacts with impending light rail station, affordable housing, the tree code. The current pandemic has limited in-person meetings for the organization but it has been active in submitting commentary and letters.</p>
<p>Minutes of May 20, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report through was approved.</p>
<p>The group then turned to having an activity that is community-oriented. Janice noted we were informed that while our arts in the Park project was on hold due to pandemic, the City did allocate $1600 to LSCC for any culture-related activity in the neighborhood, particularly promoting diversity and justice and combatting bias. Janice shared the email and offered by email and at the meeting a set of ideas on how to use the funds. (attachment) Janice will check with our partners at Clear Sky, Dianne train offered to look into musicians, and Melanie suggested we do tee-shirts. Lindsey and Janice will do some organizing on a possible event in August. The date of August 19 seemed most likely.</p>
<p>It was agreed we would touch base on whether to have a Board retreat in the fall, similar to the one we had Sept. of 2019.</p>
<p>The group then discussed the issue of recruiting a more diverse Board membership. Kathleen noted data from 2010 census that indicated Licton Springs is one of the more ethnically and racially diverse neighborhoods north of the ship canal. (attachment) The group discussed the current climate for change, given local and national issues. Mehul weighed in about the need to do outreach to people who are not homeowners, perhaps leaving flyers near apartment buildings. Janice will provide the information about the local renters she met who were doing volunteer clean-up. Lindsey and Mehul offered to do a draft of a recruiting tool poster. Janice offered to write up a statement that could be posted on our web site and Facebook page. Kathleen, who is also a block watch captain, will contact North precinct officer David Gordo to see if there are any special instructions for people neighboring the precinct building and send it along to the Board if she receives any information.</p>
<p>Notes by Kathleen Braden, secretary.</p>
<p>Next meeting July 15 by Zoom</p>
<p>ATTACHMENTS</p>
<p>Email from Janice June 12, 2020 to the Board:</p>
<p>We are receiving $1,600 to do something for the neighborhood to uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and/or cultural content. The requirements seem very loose. Given these funds were was originally ear-marked to celebrate the sacred indigenous status of Licton Springs I’d love to put some of the funds toward that AND we can do anything. Below is the start of a brainstorming list. Any other ideas? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hire local artists to paint mail boxes in the neighborhood.  \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop, record, and host a podcast series, in partnership Clear    Sky, to celebrate the LS designation \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy colored chalk for the neighborhood to create their own sidewalk     murals. Take pictures and post on our Facebook and Instagram pages  and the blog \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hiring local artists to make chalk murals around the neighborhood \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hiring musicians to perform and stroll through the neighborhood on  different nights throughout the summer - bagpipes, saxophone,   trumpet, accordion, banjo, guitar \</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Dear Arts in Parks Partner,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your patience during these difficult and challenging times for our communities.  The work that many of you continue to do to support your community through all of this has been truly inspiring.  While we are no longer able to fund your originally proposed project in full, we are looking forward to working with you to support the work you are doing that benefits our community.  Seattle needs arts and culture now more than ever. We need you and the role you play in our sector’s ecosystem and in the civic life of our City as a whole. Even if the way you carry out your work has shifted, the value you provide cannot be underestimated. </p>
<p><strong>AWARD AMOUNT</strong></p>
<p>The attached invoice is for $1,600 to support a public benefit in lieu of your original project and funding amount.</p>
<p><strong>HERE’S ALL YOU NEED TO DO:      </strong></p>
<p><strong>Respond </strong>to this email to confirm that you have received it and with a brief description of the action or project that will take the place of your originally funded event and provides artistic or cultural public benefit (please see the backside of the attached invoice-report form for suggestions).</p>
<p>This should be an action or project that is in the spirit of and supports the goals of the Arts in Parks program, of supporting under resourced communities within Seattle and supports the efforts of <strong><a href="https://seattletogether.org/">Seattle Together</a></strong>which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uplift residents by providing creative, artistic, and cultural    content</strong> (digital and analog) to residents, especially     vulnerable populations, by resourcing artists, organizers and other     cultural partners.  \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elevate, support, and uplift mutual aid efforts</strong> for     community resilience, efficacy and recovery driven by a dynamic     understanding of racial equity, neighborhood-level and cultural     community relationships, and digital technology access.   \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combatting bias/hate speech/harassment/violence</strong> amidst  Covid-19, with an awareness of how this could have impacts on   surveillance and policing practices disproportionately impacting    BIPOC communities. \</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Small-scale projects are fine and if it aligns with work that you were planning on doing to benefit your community, even better. It can be something done via an email, online, virtually, through social media, or any other method of distribution that aligns with public health guidance for physical distancing. We’re not looking for you to spend significant time making something happen. We are hoping the prompts will inspire your imagination, be forward thinking and accessible.  At this time, these funds should not be planned to go towards a postponed in-person park event.  </p>
<p>We ask that whatever action or project you do, to please include the tag #SeattleTogether and the City of Seattle logo found here: <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo">http://www.seattle.gov/arts/about-us/download-our-logo#tabs-5</a> or provide written credit. (For example: “This project was supported by Arts in Parks, a partnership with Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Seattle Office of Arts &amp; Culture.”)</p>
<p><strong>Complete</strong> an action that provides artistic or cultural public benefit.  Please email a link and/or promotional item/information about your project at least a week prior to it taking place so that we can help share it out. </p>
<p><strong>Submit your invoice and report</strong>. Once your project is complete and available to the public, complete the attached invoice form and email it to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">jenny.crooks@seattle.gov</span> along with your brief narrative report.

                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>approved Minutes May 20, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Janice Holkup, Mike Cuadra, Lindsey’s cats</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:35. She welcomed everyone. Mike Cuadra introduced himself as a former Board member. There was a discussion of zoning and urban village boundaries. Melanie will reach out to ALUV to see if there is any news on zoning.</p>
<p>There was a discussion of progress at Northgate and the Board decided to invite Susan Ward to participate in our next meeting, June 17, by zoom, if she is available to update us.</p>
<p>Minutes of April 15, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report through May 20, 2020 was approved.</p>
<p>Stay Healthy Street Program- many signs are up to close streets off in our neighborhood for vehicle traffic, as is being done throughout the city, due to the pandemic and need to maintain social distancing while people are out exercising. Janice attempted to reach Debra Juarez about the question of neighborhood input if the closures re made permanent, but she did not hear back despite also copying in her staff. Liz talked about meeting a parking enforcement officer while she and Ellen were walking but that the officer had no information about the program. Melanie suggested talking to ALUV and Greenlake CC. We looked at the West Seattle blog website and noted that Seattle Pedestrian Advisory Board and Greenways have been instrumental in the effort. The first public discussion did not occur until four weeks after the first closures were announced. Melanie and Janice will follow up. Lindsey suggested reaching out to Dan Strauss. Kathleen can contact Lee Bruch. Melanie will forward notes from Licton-Haller Greenways meeting (attached).</p>
<p>May 7 Durkan virtual town hall- Janice and Melanie attended. Janice presented our question about budget implications for Licton Springs neighborhood. The bottom line is that funds will be scarce to non-existent for projects due to huge decrease in sales tax revenue during the pandemic and business closures. Melanie provided the links sent out from the town hall and they are attached.</p>
<p>Liz asked what sort of services we could offer to the community and noted she received a nice thank you letter from Washington Food Fund for our contribution.</p>
<p>North Seattle College- Janice is our rep. and she noted that Chemane Crawford is the new interim president. We discussed the location of future residence halls on their campus but noted that due to the pandemic, it was less likely the halls would be constructed in the near future.</p>
<p>Arts-in-the-Park- although we received a greenlight for next phase of our project recognizing Licton Springs park as sacred space to Native Americans, the funding is cancelled for now from the City.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that the recruitment of people to an Advisory Board for the LSCC is put on hold until the fall due to the slowdown of activities with the pandemic.</p>
<p>Melanie reported on Seattle Arts Commission decision on temporary placements of art pieces that will be at either 92<sup>nd</sup> or 100<sup>th</sup> streets.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that Mary Amberg was leaving the police dept to take a job in the private sector and she had sent an email thanking Mary for her service to our neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Board agreed that the June and July meetings should be held via Zoom.</p>
<p>Notes by Kathleen Braden, secretary.</p>

                <p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>approved Minutes April 15, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Online meeting by Zoom due to Corona virus restrictions</p>
<p>Directors present: Amanda Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, Ellen Beck, Melanie Davies, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Attendees: Janice Holkup, Tracy Cramer, Thomas Whittemore, Noah An, Dan Strauss, Mehul Shah</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:30.</p>
<p>Minutes of March 25, 2020 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report 3/26 through 4/14/2020 was approved.  Ellen said the next report would reflect full amount received re brevity donations.</p>
<p>City Council Representative from District 6, Dan Strauss, and his staff person, Noah An, attended.  The Council members thanked them for their time. Dan gave an overview of activities at his office during this time of COVID-19 contraction. He is holding meetings with constituents over the phone and continuing work on housing and transit issues.  He noted that Licton Springs borders both Districts 5 and 6 so he is available for inquiries from Licton Springs residents. Amanda asked him about the City Council work during the COVID-19 period and Dan explained that work continues, though at  a low level and there are lots of suggestions coming from the state government.  He noted the constraints on rents now and the strain on small businesses.  Melanie asked about his perspective on the community center plans for Licton Springs-Aurora and he noted he and Juarez are working cooperatively and he is following her lead on the issue. He noted that childcare is one of his priorities.  Kathleen asked about cooperative work among Strauss, Juarez, and Pedersen for North Seattle. Strauss reminded us that as a City Council rep. he is called upon to work on behalf of the whole city, not just District 6. He believes work on a new police station for the North Precinct should be coordinated- he recently did a “ride along” with North precinct staff. He concluded his visit by thanking Thomas Whittemore for delaying his retirement due to the current crisis.</p>
<p>Jordan Haselnus of Seattle Neighborhood Group was not able to attend but sent in a proposal for a cooperative effort to do a street cleanup in the Licton Springs- Aurora area or at Mineral Springs park.  Tracy Cramer noted that last year, the group did an amazing job. She will contact Jordan about her idea.  The group agreed that litter cleanup is important, but prefer to wait until the governor’s stay at home order is lifted in May so as not to send the wrong signal, especially since the City has suspended its own clean up campaigns.</p>
<p>Janice and Tracy will write up a short piece about litter cleanup work for the Love Licton blog.</p>
<p>Janice and Kathleen noted that the Bloodmobile has been suspended for now and Bloodworks is booked into May for individual appointments. Kathleen sent out a plea for support of local foodbanks to our listserv, but has not yet gotten any responses. Lindsey noted the Washington Food Fund under the governor’s council and Philanthropy Northwest (<a href="https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund">https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund</a>). M/S/A for LSCC to donate $200 each to the Washington Food Fund and to Epic Life Church for their neighborhood food bank.  Kathleen will send Ellen the addresses so she can send paper checks to each.</p>
<p>Kathleen reported on an effort to get North Precinct Block Watch captains organized for neighborhood self-help. Thomas Whittemore reported on the Seattle Together program by the City- it is a work in progress and will need guidance and approval. </p>
<p>The group discussed the ReVisioning Northgate email  from Susan Ward on the rerouting of bus routes around the Northgate area.  Kathleen will forward her email to the Council. </p>
<p>The Council agreed to discuss in the future the prospect of having a credit card or a debit card for the Council’s bank account.  Ellen will report at the May meeting on the rider for Public Schools on our insurance coverage, due to be renewed in June.</p>
<p>Janice provided images of some tee-shirts and other swag souvenirs with the Licton Springs cattail logo that could be manufactured and sold on demand both to raise money and create neighborhood solidarity. The Council will proceed with this although it was noted we need to take care of the tax and potentially, business license, implications.  Melanie is going to check with a friend who does design about the logo.  Janice, melanie, and Lindsey will form a team to see if it is possible to launch this effort by May 2, which is Neighbor Day</p>
<p>Notes by Kathleen Braden, secretary.</p>
<p>Next meeting May 20 either by Zoom or in Licton Springs Park.</p>

A lot of information is being pushed out right now by City, King County authorities. </p>
<p>Lindsey and her husband, Mehul, are walking each street of Licton Springs neighborhood and will do a write-up and send Amanda.  Mehul is interested in LSCC eventually doing a community survey on loneliness and isolation. </p>
<p>It was noted that neighborhood restaurants are open for takeout and it is a good way to support business owners locally. Lindsey will follow up with Hector Martinez at Epic Life church who is with the local Buy Nothing group as well and see if something can be written up for the blog.</p>

                <p>(unapproved)</p>
<p><strong>LICTON SPRINGS COMMUNITY COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p>Unapproved Minutes January 22, 2020 6:30-8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>Cascadia School Library</p>
<p>Directors present: Amanda Crosley, Janice Lichtenwaldt, Ellen Beck, Liz Kearns, Lindsey Webb, and Kathleen Braden</p>
<p>Janice started the meeting at 6:30.</p>
<p>People introduced themselves.</p>
<p>Minutes of Nov. 20, 2019 were approved as distributed. The treasurer’s report 11-19-2019 through 1-15-2020 was approved.  Ellen noted that there was an additional deposit made and she would include it on the subsequent treasurer’s report. Amanda discussed her work with Randy Wiger on the proposal for the off-leash dog area at Mineral Springs Park. M/S/A that Licton Springs will contribute the value of Amanda’s work hours on this project for the future development of the proposal.  She estimates it as $100 thus far.   The group also discussed using the funds earmarked for Licton Springs Park, possibly for a summer event, with Liz’s approval because of her work as the forest steward for the park.</p>
<p>The group discussed the designation of Licton Springs Park for historic status, given its significance to the Native American communities of the region.  The process is underway and has almost reached the last stage for approval.</p>
<p>Debora Juarez (referred to in these notes below as DJ) and her staff member, Shayna Daitch (SD), joined us (delayed due to police activity in downtown Seattle due to a shooting incident earlier). DJ discussed her understanding of the history of some issues associated with the Duwamish tribe and their designation. She said the Parks Dept .(Superintendent Jesús Aguirre) had informed her of the designation decision.</p>
<p>The results of a survey of Licton Springs area residents was discussed.  DJ had it with her as LSCC had sent the results ahead and distributed a summary on our listserv (attached below)</p>
<p>DJ was asked to update the group on plans for a feasibility study of an Aurora-Licton Springs Community Center. She discussed the role of Jesús Aguirre and the Parks Dept. which will work with a community group to start the process.  $150,000 has been designated.  SD will be the point person staff contact.  DJ noted that the 6 year cycle for funding for Parks and Recreation is approaching and the feasibility study should be completed in a year.  She discussed her effort to secure the funding and the fact that the neighborhood is located in a “community center desert” in the City.  The PDOC (Park District Oversight Committee) is key to the process and once the 2020 census data comes in, that should help make the case.  DJ noted that this neighborhood has seen much growth of <em>families</em> in particular.</p>
<p>DJ then discussed all the activity occurring in District Five and how the Aurora, Northgate, and other neighborhoods are morphing into true family-oriented areas.  She talked about the need for sidewalks, a perennial problem in North Seattle. (note: residents from the Licton Springs neighborhood attended and asked her questions during the meeting so some of these notes are her responses to the questions). Subsequent to the 2019 general election, she has met with Council members Dan Strauss (District 6) and Alex Pedersen (District 4) to coordinate on issues impacting North Seattle and she is encouraged about how the representatives will work together.</p>
<p>She focused on infrastructure and development around Northgate and emphasized that much of the construction will be down with local union labor.  Newer low income housing will be constructed in the Northgate area and any current resident displaced will be able to move back in.</p>
<p>Asked about plans for the North Precinct Police Station, DJ reviewed what was the impediment to earlier plans to build a new station. Plans are till underway and there will be community hearings at North Seattle College.  Lisa Herboldt is now chair of the committee that will deal with the issue and DJ is hopeful action will happen. DJ noted that the City is still handicapped by the insufficient number of police officers and we need to be attracting many more.</p>
<p>Lindsey Webb asked about plans for a grocery store at Northgate and DJ said she is pleased with cooperation from Simon (major property owner) but City officials can only do so much where private property is involved. She has discussed, however, the demographics and character of the neighborhood and her preference for a union-shop grocery store to move into the new development.</p>
<p>Neighbors from Interlake Avenue asked about attention to development west of I-5, such as the need for a supermarket, and raised concern about the focus not being solely around the Northgate area. The group then discussed with DJ the need for attracting businesses along the Aurora corridor, including small enterprises, and reviewed pushback from Aurora Merchants to past efforts such as the moratorium and other work spearheaded by ALUV.  Again, DJ reiterated that where private property and a state highway (99) is involved, the City has a more limited role.  She discussed her efforts to work with Seattle Public Schools as the owner of the Oak Tree Village property, but that headway has not yet been made for any firm plans.</p>
<p>Janice Lichtenwaldt noted the work of ALUV and the new group, “For North” and that she has been attending some ALUV meetings and in contact with Casey Pier and there is hope to have a new phase of cooperation with business owners in the Aurora area. Amanda Crosley asked what LSCC can do to be helpful about encouraging business development, for example, with the west side of the upcoming pedestrian-bicycle bridge across I-5.  DJ noted the complications because of N Seattle College and University of Washington ownership of much of the land where the bridge ends up on the west side.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking ceremony for the bridge construction is coming up soon. SD noted that there is a need for letters of support for DJ who is calling for speeding up the Sound Transit plans for the 130<sup>th</sup> St light rail station to make it designed for a 2024 opening (to match Lynnwood link) rather than wait until 2031, which doesn’t make sense. SD will email Kathleen Braden with appropriate contact addresses to pass along.</p>
<p>The group was very happy to receive the news from DJ that the Home Zones projects are approved for money in the City budget.  In addition, SDOT has allocated $40,000 out of the regular SDOT budget for a Licton Springs Home Zone, a project supported earlier by LSCC, spearheaded by Amanda and Tim Crosley.</p>
<p>The group thanked Council Rep. Juarez and Shayna Daitch for attending and then proceeded with other business after they had to leave:</p>
<p>Resident Brigette Arden suggested that the survey done by LSCC be repeated on a regular basis to have a longitudinal record of responses and members of the LSCC Board agreed. The group discussed clean-up issues and problems with the 95<sup>th</sup> and Interlake area, especially associated with litter. Tracy Cramer, with Seattle Public Utilities and the person who deals with clean-up, attended and discussed how to report problem areas and the best way to send information to the City so that there can be a good response. She noted in particular the limitations the City or Public Utilities are under legally with respect to RVs and a 25 ft perimeter where crews are constrained about removals of trash. She took the information and said they will try to send out a crew to do cleanup on Stone Ave. N.</p>
<p>Amanda gave a report on the December 21 Mineral Springs holiday celebration and thanked everyone who participated. About fifty people attended despite the rain.  LSCC plans to do this event again in 2020.</p>
<p>Kathleen noted that we now have an electronic archive of the minutes dating back to the 1990s although there are some missing years from the mid-1990s.  It will be posted on the LSCC web site and can be searched using keywords.</p>
<p>Janice Lichtenwaldt noted the upcoming grants workshop Jan. 25 at Bitter Lake if anyone wanted to attend.</p>
<p>Kathleen Braden noted the KIRO radio selection of Liz Kearns for their “Hometown hero” award in December.  Liz said she would be doing a work party for the park with second-graders from Cascadia School. Amanda reported on the Jan 20 tree plating at 85<sup>th</sup> and Meridian.</p>
<p>Several Board members attended the January 5 Open House at North Seattle College on the I-5 Pedestrian-Bicycle Bridge.</p>
<p>Ellen proposed that LSCC order more copies of the Licton Springs brochure and the item will be on the agenda for the Feb. 26 meeting.</p>
